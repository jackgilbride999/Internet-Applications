<h1>Lab 1</h1>
<p>
    Write a simple program that counts down from 25 to 0, printing out the countdown clock as it goes using console.log (25..20..15 etc).
    <br>Write a second program to do the same thing by targeting running in a web browser. Save the code in a .html file with JavaScript enclosed in script tags.
    <br>Modify the code so that it writes the result to the webpage via the DOM.
    <br>Modify the browser code so that it writes the result to the webpage via the DOM.
    <br>Modify the code you produced in part 1 to introduce a space of 5 seconds in between the countdown digits.
    <br>Modify the above code so that when the countdown reaches 0, the user is prompted "Do you want to go again" - use the built in 'confirm' function to prompt for this.
